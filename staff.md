# First Steps for Tournament Staff

## Ask for a login
You will need a login if you don't already have one (note - for a tournament, there only needs to be one or two people with login credentials).

If approved, you will get a message from the admin team with your password.

### Verify Your Account
You will also get an email from "empty-river-3404 <no-reply@auth0user.net>" asking you to verify your account.  Click on the verify link or on the button that says Verify Your Account.
