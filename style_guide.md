# Style Guide for Announcments

When posting new announcements, it is a good idea to phrase the announcements in a similar manner.  This page is intended to suggest a common style.

The app does nothing to check the format or content of the message.

## Ring Anouncements

The most common type of announcement, usually announced belt, gender, competition, ring

1. Start with belt rank shortening "degree" to "d" or color to the initial letter.  If multiple ranks are bing called, provide a hyphenated range eg 1-3D 
1. Add the competitor type eg boys/girls/men/women
1. Age range as numbers or hyphenated ranges eg 13-14, 30-39, 60+
1. Event eg Traditional, XMA
1. Ring number or staging


```
1D boys 13-14 XMA ring 6
```

or 

```

## Irregular Announcements

Sometimes, there may be other reasons for announcements such as reminding judges to stay in rings etc.  In this case, the best practice is to provide a concise version of the announcement

```
All judges, please return to your assigned rings
```

or 

```
All Tiny Tigers to Staging
```
