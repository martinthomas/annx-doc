# Welcome to Annx - the Ring Announcement App

## Quick Intro

The Ring Announcement App (or Annx) was created to keep people at tournaments updated as new announcements are made during the day.  If you have [Annx](http://annx.ninjaarmy.net) on your screen, it will update every time a new announcement is made. Simple enough?

What kind of tournaments? Annx was created for competitors and family attending [ATA](https://www.atamartialarts.com/) taekwondo tournaments in North Texas. 

If you have a phone, tablet, iPad, laptop or smart TV then you can visit Annx and keep up to date.
